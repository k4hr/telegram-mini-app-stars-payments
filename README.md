A complete full-stack example of a modern Telegram Mini App for selling digital products using Telegram Stars payments. Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Telegram Bot API, this app includes secure invoice generation, purchase history, secret content access after purchase, and refund processing via a Python companion bot. Ideal for Web3 developers, Telegram bot creators, and digital entrepreneurs looking to monetize through Telegram's payment ecosystem.

> **Note:** This application is designed to work exclusively within the Telegram ecosystem as a Telegram Mini App. It should be accessed only through Telegram and not directly via a web browser.

## Features

- üí∏ Telegram Stars integration for payments
- üîÑ Purchase history tracking
- üì± Responsive design optimized for Telegram WebApp
- üîë Secret code delivery for purchased digital items
- üîÑ Refund support via companion bot

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Telegram bot token (obtained from BotFather)
- Python 3.7+ (for the companion bot)
- Vercel account (for deployment)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikandr-surkov/telegram-mini-app-stars-payments.git
cd telegram-mini-app-stars-payments
npm install
```

### 2. Check there is no errors during the build

## Deployment
As this is a Telegram Mini App, it must be deployed and accessed through Telegram. Follow these steps:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Sign up for a Vercel account if you haven't already
3. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and deploy the app
4. During deployment, add your `BOT_TOKEN` as an environment variable in the Vercel dashboard
5. Once deployed, Vercel will provide you with a URL for your app
6. Use this URL to set up your Telegram Mini App:
   - Go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
   - Send the command `/newapp` or choose to edit an existing bot
   - Follow the prompts to set up your Mini App, using the Vercel URL as the Web App URL
7. Once set up, you can access your Mini App through Telegram on mobile devices or in the Web version of Telegram
